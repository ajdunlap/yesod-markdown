# Sometimes necessary, sometimes problematic. Hopefully never both?

# This option is horribly mis-named: it's not "allow newer"; it's "completely
# ignore any version bounds ever"... The former is often necessary for nightly,
# but the latter is sometimes problematic. So we have no choice but to try it
# when needed, hope it doesn't break the world, and when it eventually does,
# hope whatever needed it originally is resolved. So. Fun.
