# You can't use "nightly" here, only "nightly-<date>", apparently. But you
# can't leave it blank either, so here's a value that we'll override by
# --resolver nightly.
resolver: lts-11.5
extra-deps:
  - HsYAML-0.1.1.2
  - pandoc-2.2.2.1

# Sometimes necessary, sometimes problematic. Hopefully never both?
#
# This option is horribly mis-named: it's not "allow newer"; it's "completely
# ignore any version bounds ever"... The former is often necessary for nightly,
# but the latter is sometimes problematic. So we have no choice but to try it
# when needed, hope it doesn't break the world, and when it eventually does,
# hope whatever needed it originally is resolved. So. Fun.
#
# allow-newer: true
